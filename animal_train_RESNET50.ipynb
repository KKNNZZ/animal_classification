    "# Image Classification with Pre-trained ResNet-50 using TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this JupyterLab notebook, we will explore the process of training an image classification model using the powerful ResNet-50 architecture. ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks. Our implementation will utilize the TensorFlow library, which offers a flexible platform for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to train an image classification model that can categorize images from a given dataset into distinct classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:** We will start by preparing our dataset for both training and validation. This involves using the `ImageDataGenerator` class, which efficiently loads, preprocesses, and augments image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Pre-trained ResNet-50:** To leverage the power of transfer learning, we will load a pre-trained ResNet-50 model using TensorFlow's `keras.applications` module. This pre-trained model has already learned valuable feature representations from a large dataset (ImageNet).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Classification Layers:** Building upon the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, we will add custom classification layers. These layers will adapt the model to our specific image classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Compilation:** We will compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. This step prepares the model for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training:** Our next step involves training the model using the prepared training data. During training, the model's parameters will be fine-tuned to improve classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation:** After training is complete, we will assess the model's performance using various metrics and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Saving the Model:** Finally, we will save the trained model's weights and architecture to an HDF5 file. This allows us to reuse the model later for inference without needing to retrain it.\n"
